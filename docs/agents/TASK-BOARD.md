## T-001: Home week matrix on phones
- **Objective:** at 390 px, "The week ahead" must read as a whole without the table scrolling sideways.
- **Owner:** frontend-engineer · **Dependencies:** none · **Inputs:** `docs/agents/CONTRACTS.md`; baseline screenshot `ai-system-setup/research/swello-reviews/home-v2/r3-mobile-full.png`
- **Owned files:** `src/features/home/HomeView.tsx` (the `Week` component and its call site only), `src/features/home/home.css` (`.week` rules and the `max-width: 860px` block)
- **Acceptance criteria:**
  1. At 390×844 no element in the week section is wider than the viewport, and the page has no horizontal overflow.
  2. Every spot × day value shown on desktop is still reachable on mobile (spot, day, rating word, time, offshore height).
  3. Each value is a button that sets the spot and time and opens Forecast (same behaviour as desktop), with a descriptive `aria-label`.
  4. The week's overall best hour is still marked.
  5. Desktop 1440 looks and behaves as before (table layout unchanged).
  6. `tsc --noEmit`, `npm test` (130), `npm run build` pass; no new console errors.
- **Status:** COMPLETE · **Outputs:** `handoffs/T-001-frontend.md`, `reviews/T-001-qa.md`, `reviews/T-001-code-review.md`
- **Tests performed:** tsc ✓ · npm test 130/130 ✓ · build ✓ · QA `t001-qa.mjs` at 360/390/820/1440 ✓ · `swello-qa.mjs` 72/72 (exit 0) · `home-shots.mjs` 13/13 · code review APPROVE · **Blockers:** —
- **History:** frontend-engineer implemented it → lead checked the diff and screenshots → qa-tester passed it and found D1 (dots invisible) and a crashing QA script, both regressions from 94dcf40 that the lead fixed → code-reviewer approved (1 medium finding fixed by the lead, 2 low fixed by frontend-engineer in cycle 1) → qa-tester retest passed.

## T-003: Reference-driven rebuild (BLOCKED)
Searched ~/Desktop, ~/Downloads, ~/Documents, ~/Pictures, ~/Development, the vault (excluding 99-Private) for images
newer than 2026-10-28 14:00. Found only screenshots of the old app (Desktop, 3:09–3:10 PM) and of the terminal
(8:55 PM). Needed from the user: the approved SWELLO concept images, or their path.
